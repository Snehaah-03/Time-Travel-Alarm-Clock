### Project Description
The "Time Travel Alarm Clock" is a simple web app that lets you pick a time zone and set an alarm.
It plays a sound when the alarm goes off and shows a random fun fact. It‚Äôs a playful way to manage time without any real purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Problem Statement:
We've all been there ‚Äì setting an alarm with the best intentions,
only to hit snooze and wake up late, filled with regret.
Wouldn't it be great if we could send a warning back in time,
nudging our past selves to get up on time? The Time Travel Alarm Clock aims to solve this age-old problem: 
avoiding the cycle of oversleeping and missed morning plans by, ideally, bending time itself.



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This groundbreaking device doesn‚Äôt just ring an alarm ‚Äî it sends a notification to your past self!
Sure, you might need a little quantum mechanics, a sprinkle of wormholes, and just a dash of paradox-free technology,
but hey, minor details! In theory, the clock would trigger in the future and ripple back in time to wake you up earlier.
Realistically, it‚Äôs probably just going to beep like every other alarm clock, but with way more imagination involved.
